# Day 5 - Normal Distribution II

## Task

The final grades for a Physics exam taken by a large group of students have a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 10. If we can approximate the distribution of these grades by a normal distribution, what percentage of the students:

1. Scored higher than 80 (i.e. have a `grade > 80`)?
2. Passed the test (i.e. have a `grade >= 60`)?
3. Failed the test (i.e. have a `grade < 60`)?

Find and print the answer to each question on a new line, rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.
