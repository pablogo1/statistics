# The Central Limit Theorem I

The central limit theorem (CLT) states that, for a large enough sample (n), the distribution of the sample mean will approach normal distribution. This holds for a sample of independent random variables from any distribution with a finite standard deviation.

Let `{X1, X2, ..., Xn}` be a random data set of size `n`, that is, a sequence of independent and identically distributed variables drawn from distributions of expected values given by the mean [miu] and finite variances given by [sigma_squared]. The sample average is:

For large `n`, the distribution of sample sums Sn is close to normal distribution
